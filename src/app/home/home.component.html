        My specialty is helping people heal from trauma and grief. I like to create a safe environment and
        use a collaborative approach, because I believe it is important that you have a say in your healing
        journey. Depending on your needs, I enjoy using different modalities such as Art Therapy, Sand
        Tray Therapy, Animal Assisted Therapy, and Mindfulness in addition to talk therapy with
        individuals, couples, and families.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you feel that it is the right time for you to start your healing journey, 
        please feel free to contact me. I look forward to talking with you soon!
      </p>
